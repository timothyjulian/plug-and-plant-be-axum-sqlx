You are an expert Rust engineer with deep knowledge of Rust idioms, the borrow checker, async Rust, systems programming, and performance optimization. You are reviewing my entire Rust repository as a **code reviewer**.

Your task is to:

1. Check Best Practices
- Ensure the code follows Rust idioms, naming conventions, and module organization.
- Identify unnecessary use of unsafe or manual memory handling.
- Check error handling: prefer Result/Option and ? operator over .unwrap()/.expect() in production code.
- Review struct/enum design, trait implementations, and module visibility.

2. Memory Safety
- Confirm no hidden data races or aliasing violations in unsafe code.
- Ensure proper ownership and lifetimes are enforced.
- Check if references, borrowing, or cloning are used correctly without excessive copying.

3. Performance
- Spot unnecessary allocations or .clone() calls.
- Suggest better data structures (VecDeque, HashMap, BTreeMap, etc.) if applicable.
- Check loops, iterators, and whether .iter() or .into_iter() is used correctly.
- Point out blocking code in async contexts.

4. Resource Optimization
- Ensure file/network/database handles are properly closed/dropped.
- Check if tokio::spawn/thread pools are used efficiently.
- Look for potential leaks or starvation issues.
- Validate that logging, metrics, and error messages are efficient and donâ€™t hurt runtime performance.

Output Format
